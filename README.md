# HexaBoard React App

This project was made as an example of how to use `soundfont-player` library.

The hexagonal keyboard layout was made by using [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_table_note_layout).

Using the app:
- click on the grey stripes under the keyboard, this enables sound
- click in (or hover over) the middle of the hexagons to play the note
- click between the hexagons to play chords
- change instrument if you wish
- click on GLISSANDO to switch glissando on or off

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
